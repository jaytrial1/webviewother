# Project Brief

## Core Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop an Android application and establish a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using GitHub Actions. This pipeline will automatically build an APK file upon pushes to the `main` Git branch, making the APK easily downloadable as a build artifact.

## Key Requirements

-   Android application development.
-   Automated APK builds triggered by Git pushes.
-   CI implemented with GitHub Actions.
-   Generated APKs (initially `debug` variant) should be accessible as downloadable artifacts from the CI run.
